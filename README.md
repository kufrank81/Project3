# Project3
Udagram Microservice Conversion

## Details
This is a project for the Udacity nano-degree program, where we were tasked with breaking up a monolith application into microservices.  We were then asked to create a nginx reverse proxy, and get the application deployed and running in AWS EKS.  There is also a Travis-CI element to the project that is a decent start for getting up and running in Travis-CI.  

## Contributing
This is just a project for the nano-degree and will not be maintained nor will pull requests be reviewd or accepted.
